## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a weather dataset to perform tasks such as data cleaning, filtering, and statistical analysis. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook, which provides an interactive environment for data exploration.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Blackie360/weather-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd weather-analysis
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**

   Start Jupyter Notebook using the command:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**

   Open the `Weather_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook from the Jupyter interface.

3. **Run the Cells**

   Execute the code cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis and view the results.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook performs the following tasks:

- Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
- Filters records where the weather is clear.
- Counts instances where wind speed is exactly 4 km/hr.
- Checks for NULL values in the dataset.
- Renames the column "Weather" to "Weather_Condition."
- Calculates the mean visibility of the dataset.
- Finds records with wind speed > 24 km/hr and visibility = 25 km.
- Calculates mean values for each numeric column grouped by weather condition.
- Filters instances where the weather is clear and relative humidity > 50 or visibility > 40.
- Counts the number of weather conditions that include snow.
